## Introduction
Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to find the answer entities that are multiple hops away in the Knowledge Base (KB) from the entities in the question. A major challenge is the lack of supervision signals at intermediate steps. Therefore, multi-hop KBQA algorithms can only receive the feedback from the final answer, which makes the learning unstable or ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a novel teacher-student approach for the multi-hop KBQA task. 

## Requirements:

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch >= 1.3

## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets in : WebQuestionsSP (webqsp), Complex WebQuestions 1.1 (CWQ), and MetaQA.
* We follow [GraftNet](https://github.com/OceanskySun/GraftNet) to preprocess the datasets and construct question-specific graph.

|Datasets | Train| Dev | Test | #entity| coverage |
|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|MetaQA-1hop| 96,106 | 9,992 | 9,947 | 487.6 | 100%|
|MetaQA-2hop| 118,980 | 14,872 | 14,872 | 469.8 | 100%|
|MetaQA-3hop| 114,196 | 14,274 | 14,274 | 497.9| 99.0%|
|webqsp| 2,848 | 250 | 1,639 | 1,429.8 | 94.9%|
|CWQ| 27,639 | 3,519 | 3,531 | 1,305.8 | 79.3%|

Each dataset is organized with following structure:
- `data-name/`
  - `*.dep`: file contains question id, question text and dependency parsing (not used in our code);
  - `*_simple.json`: dataset file, every line describes a question and related question-specific graph;
  - `entities.txt`: file contains a list of entities;
  - `relations.txt`: file contains list of relations.
  - `vocab_new.txt`: vocab file.
  - `word_emb_300d.npy`: vocab related glove embeddings.

## Training Instruction
Download preprocessed datasets from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qRXeuoL-ArQY7pJFnMpNnBu0G-cOz6xv?usp=sharing),
and unzip it into dataset folder, and use config --data_folder <data_path> to indicate it.
reported models for webqsp and CWQ dataset are available at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15J02zSJTZUFyeBv-hk-2FII3qEoIVyr2/view?usp=sharing).
use following args to run the code

```
example commands: run_webqsp.sh, run_CWQ.sh, run_metaqa.sh
```
